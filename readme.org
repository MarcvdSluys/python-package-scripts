#+title: Python package scripts

Here are the bash scripts I use to create and check Python packages and to upload them to PyPI.  These are
very much tailored to my usage and laptop system, but you may want to adapt them for your case.  The main
reason for these is my faulty memory --- as I do not perform most of these tasks on a daily basis, I need to
look up how to do them.  I basically turned my notes in to bash scripts.  Note that not very much design went
into writing these scripts; they evolved organically as my needs became clear.
